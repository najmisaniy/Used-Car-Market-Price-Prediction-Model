# Used Car Price Prediction Model

This repository contains a machine learning model designed to predict the prices of used cars based on various features such as make, model, year, mileage, condition, and more. The project utilizes regression techniques to provide accurate price estimations, which can be useful for car dealerships, sellers, and buyers.

## Key Features:
- **Data Collection:** Extensive dataset including car specifications, historical prices, and market trends.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, feature engineering, and data normalization to improve model performance.
- **Modeling:** Implemented various regression models including Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
- **Evaluation:** Performance metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared are used to evaluate model accuracy.
- **Visualization:** Data insights and model performance visualized through charts and plots.
- **Deployment:** Instructions on how to deploy the model for real-time price prediction using Gradio.

## Technologies Used:
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Gradio

## How to Use:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Run the model training script to build the prediction model.
4. Use the provided Gradio interface to make predictions on new data.

## Future Work:
- Incorporate more features such as regional pricing variations.
- Enhance the model using deep learning techniques.
- Implement real-time data updates and predictions.
